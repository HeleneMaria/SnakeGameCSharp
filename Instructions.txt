First, use the menu bar to choose the player mode.
You can choose one player, that doesnt't require any network connection. 
In that mode, you can see your score and the time from the beginning of you game. 
To begin moving your snake, you have to press one of the arrow keys, knowing that the head of the snake is at the left, so you cannot go to the right.

You can also choose the two players mode. In this case, a sub menu is displayed, and you have to choose between player 1 and player 2.
Be careful if you choose the player 1, your opponent has to be player 2, and conversely. If you choose the same numbered player, the game will never start. 
In that case, the only option is to quit by clicking on the red cross.
During the game, you can see the snake of your opponent at the right bottom of your window, as well as his score.

You can quit the program by clicking on "exit" at anytime, even if you are playing with another player.

Moreover, the time is displayed at the top right side of the window using a native function.
